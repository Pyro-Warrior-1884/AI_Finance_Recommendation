# AI Financal Management Recommendation
This project is a financial management web application built using React.js with CSS for styling. It enables users to categorize expenses, receive personalized insurance recommendations, and determine appropriate emergency fund allocations. The system collects user input on financial details, which is then processed using the Gemini AI API to generate insightful recommendations. Each response from Gemini AI is stored in Firebase, ensuring that users can access their previous financial insights. The responses are displayed in descending order, with the most recent recommendations appearing first, providing users with an intuitive and organized experience. This project streamlines financial planning by leveraging AI-driven analysis, offering users an efficient way to optimize their spending, insurance coverage, and savings.
